# 📁 Wallpaper Pack Store – Project Spec

## 🧭 Project Overview

This is a digital storefront built around the idea of selling themed wallpaper packs (desktop or mobile) for a small fee (e.g. $1). The site aims to be visually appealing, super simple to use, and frictionless in the buying process.

The goal is to create a clean, modern one-stop-shop that blends aesthetics with a streamlined user flow: discover a pack → preview it → pay → download it.

The entire vibe should match the creator’s personal taste — authentic, stylish, and easy to navigate.

## 🎯 Core Goals

1. **Showcase & Sell**: Display wallpaper packs in a visually-driven format.

3. **Instant Access**: Immediately deliver downloads post-purchase.
4. **Easy Management**: Make it easy to add/edit new packs manually through metadata or files.
5. **Mobile & Desktop Friendly**: Ensure seamless access from any device.
6. **Maintain Creator Identity**: Maintain a vibe that feels personal and curated.
